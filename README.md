# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to refactor VBA code in the macro-enabled workbook [VBA Challenge.xlsm](/VBA Challenge.xlsm) to reduce it's run time and in conjunction reduce the required processing dedication.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of the workbook is to output an analytical summary of the worksheet desired by the user. The macro will produce a list of tickers, their total daily volume, and their return.

Within the excel workbook, there are two modules attached with it. Module 1 contains VBA code for additional other macros created during the instructional section. Module 2 contains refactored code for the primary purpose of the new workbook.

## Results

Below are screenshots of the code run from Module 1- the original code.
